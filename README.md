# COVID Chatbot ![prolog](https://img.shields.io/badge/SWI--Prolog-8.2.3-success)
This is a simple chatbot that recognizes if you typed in one of the three major symptoms of COVID.

Written in Prolog, it performs pattern matching based on what the user inputs. If the user mentions, they have any/all of the 3 major symptoms (ie. cough, fever, tiredness), the chatbot responds.

## To run:
Making sure both files are in the same directory, open the chatbot file in your Prolog compiler of choice and it will prompt you to start

## Things to add:
Better responses eventually for what an user can input. Right now, it just checks for the symptoms and if it's not a response with a symptom, it will spit out a generic response for the user to provide more information or enter a command to see more information.
